We have 2 datasets, a NYC environmental complaints dataset and a NYC demographics dataset

We didn't use any code for data ingestion but here are the links to the 2 datasets.


Environmental Complaints Dataset:
DOHMH Indoor Environmental Complaints | NYC Open Data (cityofnewyork.us)

Demographics Dataset:
Demographic, Social, Economic, and Housing Profiles by Community District/PUMA | NYC Open Data (cityofnewyork.us)
